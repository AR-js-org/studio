# How to upload .GLTF

## Export your project with separated files
In case you are using Blender you will have three options to export your .gltf file:

1. glTF Binary (.glb)
2. glTF Separate (.gltf + .bin + textures)
3. glTF Embedded (.gltf)

If you see the error message

> *Please pack all related files to zip file and try again.

then use option 2. glTF Separate (.gltf + .bin + textures), zip the files that have been exported with default settings and try again. Tested on Google Chrome on Macbook Pro 2019 (Intel chip), MacOS 12.1.
